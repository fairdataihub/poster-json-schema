Poetry is prominent in texts from these time periods and one of its characteristics is the use of metaphor. Distinguishing figurative and literal words or phrases is a major task for scholars in the Humanities, especially in the fields of literature, linguistics, and hermeneutics. We present a new, challenging dataset of early medieval Hebrew poetry with expert annotations of metaphors with baseline results.",
      "methods": "Three language models were evaluated: BEREL (pre-trained on 220 million words of medieval Hebrew texts), AlephBERT (pre-trained on 2 billion words of modern Hebrew), and AlephBERT Adapted (trained on 2 billion modern Hebrew words plus 10 million additional medieval words from Project Ben-Yehuda and the Piyyut dataset). Two approaches were tested: fine-tuning for metaphor detection using pre-trained and adapted language models with tokenizers, and language model adaptation by training on additional prose and poetic medieval texts. The models classify words as metaphor or not-a-metaphor.",
      "results": "The dataset consists of early medieval Hebrew poems with 180 labeled texts, 7,000 sentences, and 45,000 words. Fifteen percent of the words are metaphors. Inter-annotator agreement achieved a Cohen's kappa of 0.618, considered substantial. Model performance on the test set showed: AlephBERT achieved an F1 score of 44.404, BEREL achieved 48.3, and AlephBERT Adapted achieved 46.56. BEREL, pre-trained on medieval texts, shows the best results. AlephBERT is outperformed by AlephBERT Adapted.",
      "conclusions": "BEREL, the language model pre-trained specifically on medieval Hebrew texts, achieved the highest performance for metaphor detection in early medieval Hebrew poetry. The adapted version of AlephBERT, which combined modern and medieval training data, outperformed the base AlephBERT model, demonstrating the value of domain adaptation.",
