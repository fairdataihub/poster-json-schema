      "description": "Human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) layers have the potential to provide an increasingly improved alternative to cell lines as they differentiate into multiple intestinal cell types that are also present in vivo. However, these models currently lack immunocompetence, as they do not contain immune cells like for instance dendritic cells (DCs) that play an important role in intestinal immune responses. This poster presents the development and characterization of an immunocompetent hiPSC-derived IEC model by co-culturing IEC layers with MUTZ-3 derived DCs. The poster demonstrates that hiPSC-derived IEC layers consist of multiple cell types present in the intestine in vivo and have the capacity to induce pro-inflammatory responses when exposed to a pro-inflammatory stimulus. MUTZ-3-derived DCs express immature and mature DC markers when differentiated. Co-culture of separately differentiated IECs and DCs was successful using an inverted IEC culture technique. 24h co-culture of IECs and DCs did not negatively affect the differentiation status of the cells and significantly increased cytokine expression in both cell models. As a case study, the model was tested with microplastics exposure, showing that 24h and 48h exposure of immature DCs to micro/nanoplastics did not result in strong immunomodulatory effects of any of the materials tested (HDPE269, PET_c000, PS394Eu).",

However, these models currently lack immunocompetence, as they do not contain immune cells like for instance dendritic cells (DCs) that play an important role in intestinal immune responses.",
      "methods": "Study design: hiPSCs and MUTZ-3 cells were differentiated into IECs and mature DCs separately and co-cultured when fully differentiated. After 24h of co-culture the differentiation status of the IECs and DCs and the expression of cytokines was evaluated and compared to their respective monocultures before co-culture. Characterization involved immunohistochemistry, gene expression analysis, barrier integrity measurements (TEER and permeability), and cytokine quantification (ELISA). For microplastics exposure, immature DCs were exposed to HDPE269, PET_c000, and PS394Eu at 25, 50, and 100 μg/ml for 24h and 48h.",
      "results": "hiPSC-derived IECs: The differentiation protocol produced IEC layers containing multiple intestinal cell types (LGR5+ intestinal stem cells, GLP-1+ enteroendocrine cells, UEA-1+ Paneth cells and goblet cells, TFF3+ mature goblet cells). IECs showed immune responsiveness with increased cytokine storm pathway gene expression, maintained barrier integrity, and IL-8 excretion after pro-inflammatory stimulation. MUTZ-3 dendritic cells: Gene expression showed decreased progenitor markers (CD14, CD34) and increased mature DC markers (CD80, CD11c, DC-LAMP, OX40L, CCR7) during differentiation from D0 to D9. Co-culture model: 24h co-culture did not negatively affect differentiation status but significantly increased cytokine expression in both IECs and DCs. Microplastics exposure: 24h and 48h exposure of immature DCs to micro/nanoplastics showed no cytotoxicity. After 48h exposure to PS394Eu plastics, mild effects on cytokine expression (IL-6, IL-8, IL-12β, IL-15, IL-18, IL-23, TNFα) were observed.",
      "conclusions": "hiPSC-derived IEC layers consist of multiple cell types that are present in the intestine in vivo. hiPSC-derived IEC layers have the capacity to induce pro-inflammatory responses when exposed to a pro-inflammatory stimulus. MUTZ-3-derived DCs express (immature/mature) DC markers when differentiated. Co-culture of separately differentiated IECs and DCs was successful using an inverted IEC culture technique. 24h co-culture of IECs and DCs did not appear to negatively affect the differentiation status of the cells and significantly increased cytokine expression in both cell models. 24h and 48h exposure of iDCs to micro/nanoplastics did not result in strong immunomodulatory effects of any of the materials tested.",
