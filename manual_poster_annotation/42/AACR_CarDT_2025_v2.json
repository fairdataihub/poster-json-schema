      "description": "Carcinogenic Determination via Transformers (CarD-T) is an automated pipeline that combines transformer-based machine learning with probabilistic analysis to identify potential carcinogens from biomedical literature. Only 479 carcinogenic entities are officially recognized as carcinogens across regulatory databases (IARC, NTP, EPA, ECHA, and OSHA). Regulatory agencies rely on manual curation and are burdened by exponential growth of biomedical literature. CarD-T addresses these limitations by using a Named Entity Recognition (NER) ELECTRA LLM trained on carcinogen-specific contexts from PubMed literature to automate literature review of carcinogen curation with probabilistic analysis of likely carcinogenicity. The framework processes accumulating scientific publications, applies a trained NER model to extract potential carcinogenic entities, and uses Probabilistic Carcinogen Denomination (PCarD) to analyze temporal trends in evidence shifts. This approach enables classification of candidates through Bayesian temporal analysis, overcoming limitations of traditional manual literature review methods.",

Regulatory agencies rely on manual curation and are burdened by exponential growth of biomedical literature. CarD-T is an LLM framework developed to automate literature review of carcinogen curation with probabilistic analysis of likely carcinogenicity. The framework addresses the challenge that current systems, like those run by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and the National Toxicology Program, face challenges due to manual vetting and disparities in carcinogen classification spurred by the volume of emerging data.",
