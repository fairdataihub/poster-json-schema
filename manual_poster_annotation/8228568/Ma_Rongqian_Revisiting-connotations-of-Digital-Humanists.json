      "introduction": "This ongoing study revisits the connotations of 'digital humanists' and explores the reasons why a researcher does or does not self-identify as a digital humanist. Building on semi-structured interview data collected from fourteen researchers and practitioners engaging in digital humanities (DH) projects, this poster illustrates researchers' various understandings of 'digital humanist' as a term and research identity and highlights the complexity of 'digital humanists' as a research community. This study contributes to DH scholarship with insights into the collective imaginations of the 'digital humanist' as a research community one decade after the early attempts. Findings of this research study also facilitate a more thorough, timely, and dynamic discussion of the major workforce in digital humanities, potentially paving the way for future research on labor and collaboration in the DH research domain. The study addresses the question of who is in and who is out of the digital humanities community, building on early deliberations from scholars like Alvarado, Ramsay, and Jänicke. Alvarado defined a digital humanist as someone who aims to develop deep domain knowledge of the traditional humanist, learns a wide variety of technologies and programming languages, and critically situates technologies as cultural artifacts. Ramsay characterized a digital humanist as a humanities scholar who can build something with digital methods. Jänicke advocated for an inclusive conception of digital humanists, emphasizing active participation from researchers of various knowledge domains, especially those from scientific fields.",
      "methods": "The study employed qualitative semi-structured interviews with fourteen participants representing eight domains: history, religious studies, English, art history, sociology, information science, mathematics, and anthropology. Participants represented six levels of training: Master's students, PhD candidates, postdoc, assistant professors, associate professors, and curator. The inclusive screening criterion was any researcher or practitioner who has been actively engaging in DH projects. Two primary interview questions guided the research: (1) Do you self-identify as a digital humanist, depending on your personal understanding of the term? (2) Why or why not? Responses were systematically analyzed to identify patterns and themes in how researchers understand and relate to the term 'digital humanist.'",
      "results": "Among the fourteen participants, eight self-identified as digital humanists while six did not. Those who self-identified (n=8) cited two main reasons: competence in digital methods, particularly programming and coding, and active work in teaching or supervising students in digital humanities. For example, participants noted their backgrounds in various fields combined with coding skills and use of computational methods. Those who did not self-identify (n=6) cited four main reasons: not considering themselves humanists due to their research questions approaching from information science rather than humanities perspectives; concerns about their technical skills, particularly programming abilities; belief that digital humanities does not raise fundamentally new research questions distinct from conventional humanities; and the view that digital methods are useful but not necessary for their research questions. The findings reveal that researchers' self-confidence in technical literacy and the nature of their research questions significantly affect their self-identification as digital humanists.",
      "conclusions": "The study demonstrates that the identity of 'digital humanist' remains complex and contested. Self-identification is influenced by multiple factors including technical competence, disciplinary background, the nature of research questions, and individual perceptions of what constitutes digital humanities work. The research highlights the ongoing challenge of defining boundaries and membership in the digital humanities community.",

Table 1 shows reasons why researchers self-identify as digital humanists (n=8): Competent in digital methods (programming and coding in particular) - P2, P6, P7, P9, P11 provided examples of having backgrounds in various fields combined with coding knowledge and data analysis skills. Active working, teaching, or supervising students in DH - P4, P10, P14 noted they do research in digital humanities and teach or supervise in this area. Table 2 shows reasons why researchers do NOT self-identify as digital humanists (n=6): Not a 'humanist' - P12, P13 indicated their research questions approach from information science rather than humanities perspectives. Concerned with technical skills (programming in particular) - P8 stated they are just starting to learn programming and see being a digital humanist as a future goal. DH does not raise new research questions - P3 noted that new constructs such as DH did not generate fundamentally new questions distinct from conventional humanities. Digital methods are not necessary - P1, P5 indicated their research questions can be addressed with digital methods but are not ultimately bound to them."
