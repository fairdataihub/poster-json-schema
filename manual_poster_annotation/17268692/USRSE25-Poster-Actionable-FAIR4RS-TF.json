      "description": "This poster presents the Actionable Guidelines for FAIR Research Software Task Force, established in December 2024 under the Research Software Alliance (ReSA). The Task Force addresses the challenge that FAIR4RS principles, while providing a framework for making research software Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable, lack concrete implementation steps. Through a comprehensive, community-driven methodology involving six subgroups conducting literature reviews and community outreach, the Task Force aims to create actionable and domain-agnostic guidelines for implementing the FAIR4RS principles. The poster outlines the background, problem statement, proposed solution, current progress including preliminary findings on metadata for software reuse, and next steps toward releasing draft guidelines in March 2026 and the first official version in Summer 2026. The Task Force brings together approximately 12 active members from diverse international locations (Germany, Spain, UK, USA, etc.) and research domains (Biomedical, Data Science, Knowledge Representation, etc.).",

The methodology includes personal assessment, literature review, and external feedback to establish answers for outstanding questions related to the 17 FAIR4RS principles.

      "introduction": "Research software is a critical element of modern scientific research. Making it FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) is crucial to support reproducibility, transparency, sustainability, and scientific progress. The FAIR4RS principles (2022) provide a framework to achieve this through unique identifiers, metadata, license, and more. They are now being adopted by researchers, organizations, and funders worldwide. However, by design, the FAIR4RS principles do not provide concrete implementation steps, making them difficult for developers to apply. Field-specific guidelines, such as FAIR-BioRS (2023), exist but lack broad, cross-disciplinary input. The 2 year community survey of the FAIR4RS principles confirmed the need for generalized actionable guidelines.",
      "methods": "We began by conducting an in-depth analysis of the FAIR4RS principles and identified six key categories where actionable instructions are needed, each with a series of outstanding questions. Six subgroups are now conducting literature reviews and community outreach to answer these questions. The approach includes literature review, personal assessment, and external feedback. The subgroup working on category C5 is investigating what provenance and other metadata are necessary for software reuse, and how to provide that metadata. The Task Force is run by a diverse international team of approximately 12 active members from various locations (Germany, Spain, UK, USA, etc.) and research domains (Biomedical, Data Science, Knowledge Representation, etc.).",
      "results": "We identified 6 categories where actionable guidelines are needed, corresponding to the 17 FAIR4RS principles: C1 (Identifier), C2 (Metadata for software publication & discovery), C3 (Standards for inputs & outputs), C4 (Qualified references), C5 (Metadata for software reuse), and C6 (License). For category C5, preliminary findings suggest that provenance metadata (authors info, funding details) and other metadata (software description, required dependencies) are essential, with codemeta.json identified as a method to provide this metadata.",
      "conclusions": "The Actionable FAIR4RS Task Force is making significant progress toward creating comprehensive, domain-agnostic guidelines for implementing the FAIR4RS principles. The next steps include: December 2025 - subgroups complete investigations; March 2026 - release draft guidelines for community feedback; Summer 2026 - publish the first official version; Fall 2026 - transition to a maintained, living resource that evolves with community input.",
