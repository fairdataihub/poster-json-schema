      "description": "We present an ongoing research effort to identify ionization sources in nearby AGN using Apache Point Observatory (APO) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We measure emission line ratios along the spatial extents of the narrow line region (NLR) using spectra from APO's Dual Imaging Spectrograph (DIS) and HST's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS). The spectra reveal prominent emission lines of ionized gas that can be primarily attributed to star formation or AGN ionization. We construct BPT diagrams and compare with HST color images to isolate these regions and determine their connection to the kinematics of the outflowing gasses. When combined with our ongoing study of mass outflow rates, these efforts will help further our overall goal of determining the effectiveness of AGN feedback on their host galaxies. We present two targets: NGC 1667, a Seyfert 2 galaxy with observed redshift of z = 0.01517 (319 pc/\"), and NGC 4051, a Seyfert 1 galaxy with z = 0.00234 (53 pc/\"). Overlaid APO BPT diagrams correspond well to visual regions of star formation and AGN ionization displayed in the HST images. Identification of ionization mechanisms are consistent for the [N II], [S II], and [O I] ratios, providing confidence in our methodology.",

We present two of our targets: NGC 1667, a Seyfert 2 galaxy with observed redshift of z = 0.01517 (319 pc/\"), and NGC 4051, a Seyfert 1 galaxy with z = 0.00234 (53 pc/\") (Verheijen & Sancisi, 2001).

We add a colorbar to each BPT diagram to indicate distance from the center of the observed slit. Using the above data, we generate ionization maps to show the primary source of ionization of the brightest flux component along each position angle in the NLR and into the extended NLR (ENLR) within the host galaxy.",
      "results": "Overlaid APO BPT diagrams correspond well to visual regions of star formation and AGN ionization displayed in the HST images (such as the star formation arm SW of the central AGN in NGC 4051). Identification of ionization mechanisms are consistent for the [N II], [S II], and [O I] ratios, providing confidence in our methodology. NGC 1667 displays BPT diagrams for three position angles (PA = 55°, 108°, 160°) showing high flux and low flux components as a function of distance from the nucleus. NGC 4051 displays BPT diagrams for three position angles (PA = 98°, 233°, 188°) with a fourth slit position angle at 143° not shown. The ionization maps show primary regional ionization mechanisms: star formation (blue), AGN ionization (red) and composite (green).",
      "conclusions": "Additional work is needed to compare our ionization maps with spatially-resolved maps of the kinematics and mass-outflow rates generated by other members of our group. Similar overlays and analyses will be done for 6 additional Seyfert galaxies, including Mrk 78, NGC 1068, and Mrk 3 to compare spatially resolved mass outflow rates with the local ionization mechanisms."
