      "description": "Linezolid is a critically important antibiotic to fight human infections caused by multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria such as MRSA and VRE. Linezolid resistance can be caused by point mutations in the 23SrRNA gene and by plasmid-borne genes: cfr, optrA and poxtA. While linezolid is not licenced for use in food-producing animals, linezolid resistant isolates were retrieved from food-producing animals in different European countries including Belgium. The project aims to assess the occurrence of linezolid resistance in enterococci and staphylococci in 2019 in Belgium with a selective culture method. Another endpoint is to investigate the genetic environment associated with the linezolid-resistant phenotype and the relatedness of the isolates. Linezolid resistance occurrence ranged in faecal samples from 0% in turkeys to 16.4% in veal calves and reached up to 25.7% in nasal samples from fattening pigs. WGS results showed that linezolid-resistant staphylococci carried only the cfr gene while three genes were found in linezolid-resistant enterococci: cfr, poxtA and optrA. MLST analysis revealed 28 and 32 different sequence types for Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium respectively. The study reveals a reservoir of plasmid-borne linezolid-resistance genes in the agricultural sector with potential for cross-selection by other antibiotics including phenicols.",

      "results": "Linezolid resistance occurrence was ranging in faecal samples from 0% in turkeys to 16.4% in veal calves and reaching up to 25.7% in nasal samples from fattening pigs, all bacterial species combined. WGS and Resfinder results showed that linezolid-resistant staphylococci (n=7) carried only the cfr gene (n=7) while the three genes were found in linezolid-resistant enterococci (n=143): cfr (n=3), poxtA (n=36) and optrA (n=124). One poxtA was observed in a Pediococcus pentosaceus. All linezolid-resistant isolates lacking linezolid-resistance genes (n=4) contained 23S rRNA mutation. poxtA was not observed in the investigated human isolates. WGS results showed that cfr and optrA were often associated with fexA gene (resistance to phenicols) and that poxtA was associated with fexB (according to reads mapping analysis). Investigation of genetic organisation revealed 4 different organisations for cfr, 20 for optrA and one for poxtA. No differences were observed between animal and human isolates regarding the genetic organisations. In all cases, several resistance genes were carried by the isolates and in most cases, contigs carrying linezolid-resistance genes carried also other resistance genes (mostly resistance genes to phenicols and/or macrolides and/or aminoglycosides). MLST analysis was performed on the Staphylococcus aureus (n=6), Enterococcus faecalis (n=80) and Enterococcus faecium (n=48) isolates. Only one sequence type was observed for S. aureus, ST398. Regarding enterococci, 28 and 32 different STs were observed for E. faecalis and E. faecium respectively including new STs for both species.",
      "conclusions": "Linezolid resistance is not so rare in animal isolates, revealing a reservoir of plasmid-borne linezolid-resistance genes in the agricultural sector. Moreover, the majority of the isolates carried also phenicol resistance genes. Several different organisations and sequence types were observed in the isolates collection. These observations revealed a large diversity of linezolid resistant isolates and a reservoir of bacteria susceptible to share linezolid resistance genes that could be cross-selected by other antibiotics including phenicols. Further investigation of relatedness between the isolates will be done through cgMLST and phylogenomic analysis. Conjugation assays will be done to investigate the transferability of the observed linezolid resistance genes.",
